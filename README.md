## Upcoming Updates

I will be updating this documentation with the latest information and instructions in the near future. 

## Application

This design is specifically tailored for use in power switching applications and is compatible with various types of switches including:

- **IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor)**: Ideal for high-voltage, high-current applications.
- **MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor)**: Suitable for fast switching with lower power loss.
- **SiCFET (Silicon Carbide Field-Effect Transistor)**: Perfect for high-efficiency, high-frequency operations.
